description: Philosophy teaches valuable lessons in argument formation, respectful disagreement, and epistemic humility. My aim as an instructor is to guide students as they develop into better critical thinkers and to encourage self-reflection, charitable reconstruction of opposing views, and careful argumentation.

    As a course supervisor at the University of Cambridge, I am responsible for organizing undergraduate students into small groups for seminar style discussion. For each group, I assign readings and essay topics each week, provide detailed comments, and facilitate discussion. I have several terms of experience teaching the following courses.

        The increasing power and pervasiveness of artificially intelligent systems raises numerous important philosophical questions: Is technology value neutral? Do artefacts have politics? Is automated decision-making fair? When developing AI, should we aim for transparency over accuracy? This course covers core topics in the ethics and politics of technology through the lens of questions raised by contemporary advances in AI.

        Part IB History and Philosophy of Science is a year-long course that offers a wide-ranging overview of the nature of science and its place in society. The philosophical portion of the course covers issues such as how to characterize scientific method, the reliability of induction, the nature and status of objectivity in science, and the complex inter-relationships between scientific research and social values. We also touch on philosophical issues related to specific fields of science, including physics, biology, medicine and psychiatry, cognitive science, and the social sciences.
