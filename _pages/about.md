I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Philosophy and Ethics of Artificial Intelligence in the [Department of Philosophy](https://phil.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida supervised by [Professor Cameron Buckner](http://cameronbuckner.net/). 

I work on the history and philosophy of artificial intelligence. My work analyzes how deep learning architectures place interpretable constraints on representation learning and the relationship between these constraints and inductive reliability. I also have projects in the philosophy of cognitive science, general philosophy of science, epistemology, and social-political philosophy, especially where these areas intersect with aspects of machine learning.

Before UF, I did my PhD in the [Department of History and Philosophy of Science](https://www.hps.cam.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge where I was a [Gates Cambridge Scholar](https://www.gatescambridge.org/).

In addition to my PhD, I also served as a Student Fellow at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence](http://lcfi.ac.uk).



 

<!--My dissertation develops a pragmatist epistemology of deep learning in scientific practice. I emphasize the theoretical foundations of statistical learning as a source of pragmatic understanding, which involves empirically tested methods of engineering models that facilitate reliable prediction and control. This approach leads me to consider conceptual issues with prominent validation methods, including cross-validation, calibration, and uncertainty estimation, contrasting these contemporary practices with parallels in the history of scientific instruments..

 My current research broadly concerns the epistemic, moral, and political significance of machine learning in science and public life. Tackling these issues leads me to confront fundamental questions concerning the role non-epistemic values in science and technology, the relationship between various conceptions of objectivity and trust, and the nature and importance of uncertainty estimates for responsibility.
